My research lays at the nexus between conservation ecology, statistics, and data science. Having studied adaptation of migratory bird populations to environmental pressures, I am currently on a track to developing a system that will use birds as living sensors for global near real-time detection of environmental pressures.

My current research explores how migratory birds adjust their annual routines to environmental stressors as they successively connect arrays of ecosystems laying far away and functioning independently from each other. I apply existing and develop custom advanced methods in geospatial analysis and frequentist and Bayesian statistical modelling to combine diverse datasets, such as satellite imagery, count and capture-recapture, and tracking data. With this integrated analysis I find that in a stable population, as a result of the annual cycle connectivity, selection pressures are evenly distributed in space and time. Facing fitness-compromising conditions at a certain stage of the annual cycle, animals redistribute their detrimental effects trading their fitness at earlier or later stages. Based on this, I argue that conservation efforts undertaken locally can mitigate environmental pressures on a population in other seasons, sometimes thousands of kilometres away.

My perspective on redistribution of fitness costs as a pathway of disturbed animal populations to achieve stability opens new avenues in ecology. Degree of seasonal variation in survival rates invites evaluation of population maladaptation as well as the use of migratory animals as generic earth observation sensors of environmental change. In applied ecology, my insights imply effectiveness of local efforts in solving global population problems and call for refocusing of conservation and restoration programs.

I am currently in search for new perspectives and opportunities, so feel free to contact me.
