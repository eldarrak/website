My research lays at the nexus between conservation ecology, statistics, and data science. Having studied adaptation of migratory bird populations to environmental pressures, I am currently on a track to developing a system that will use birds as living sensors for global near real-time detection of environmental pressures.

I explore how migratory birds adjust their annual routines to environmental stressors as they successively connect arrays of ecosystems laying far away and functioning independently from each other. I apply existing and develop custom advanced methods in geospatial analysis and frequentist and Bayesian statistical modelling to combine diverse datasets, such as satellite imagery, count and capture-recapture, and tracking data. With this integrated analysis I find that in a stable population, as a result of the annual cycle connectivity, selection pressures are evenly distributed in space and time. Facing fitness-compromising conditions at a certain stage of the annual cycle, animals redistribute their detrimental effects trading their fitness at earlier or later stages. Based on this, I argue that conservation efforts undertaken locally can mitigate environmental pressures on a population in other seasons, sometimes thousands of kilometres away.

I am currently in search for new perspectives and opportunities, so feel free to contact me.
