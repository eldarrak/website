I had a pleasure to work in Ithaca with David Winkler. He started and for many years maintains a huge colony of nest boxes. Tree swallows living in these boxes are cute birds with low survival rates and this makes them different  from shorebirds I used to work before. These birds just have to reproduce, so they arrive super early to get a nest box. Lay second clutch if the first was not successful and have to find food despite coldsnaps.
