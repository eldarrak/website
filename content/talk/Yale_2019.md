abstract = "Long distance migratory birds stretch their annual routines over diverse and disconnected biomes. At every life-cycle stage, the migrants embed in a new local ecosystem, which functions independently from the other ecosystems along the migratory route. In my talk, I will sketch out how migratory birds adapt their annual routines to the asynchronously changing world."
